# Knowledge-Enhancement-Career-Advancement-With-MOOC

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have transformed the education industry by providing accessible 
online learning opportunities. This project utilizes a smart framework to analyze MOOC datasets, 
exploring the relationship between student activity and course completion rates. Challenges 
encountered includes preprocessing the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, 
normalizing numerical features, and optimizing model performance. By quantifying learner participation 
through video consumption patterns and employing data mining tools, significant correlations are 
uncovered. These findings offer valuable insights for the MOOC industry, informing course design and 
learner engagement strategies. Ultimately, this project enhances educational experiences and outcomes 
for learners worldwide
